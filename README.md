# bitwiseoperators
1) Aim:
The aim of this code is to demonstrate bitwise operations, including setting and resetting specific bits in an integer, left shift, and right shift operations.

Theory:

Bitwise OR (|) Operation:

Bitwise OR combines two integers by setting the corresponding bits if at least one of them is set. The result has the bits set where either of the operands has a bit set.
Bitwise AND (&) Operation:

Bitwise AND combines two integers by setting the corresponding bits only if both operands have those bits set. The result has the bits set where both operands have bits set.
Left Shift (<<) Operation:

Left shifting an integer moves its bits to the left by a specified number of positions, filling in zeros from the right.
Right Shift (>>) Operation:

Right shifting an integer moves its bits to the right by a specified number of positions, filling in zeros from the left.
Algorithm:

Initialize given, set, and reset integers with specific values.

Use the bitwise OR (|) operator to set specific bits in given using set and store the result in set_ans.

Use the bitwise AND (&) operator to reset specific bits in given using reset and store the result in reset_ans.

Display the values of set_ans and reset_ans.

Initialize an integer i with a specific value.

Perform a left shift operation on i by 3 positions and store the result in l.

Perform a right shift operation on i by 4 positions and store the result in r.

Display the values of l and r.

Initialize an integer a with a specific value.

Prompt the user to enter the bit positions to be reset and set.

Use the left shift (<<) operator to set the specified bit in a and store the result in a1.

Use the left shift (<<) operator to set the specified bit in a and store the result in a2.

Display the values of a1 and a2.

Conclusion:
This code demonstrates various bitwise operations, including setting and resetting specific bits in an integer, as well as left shift and right shift operations. It allows users to input specific bit positions to set and reset in an integer and displays the results of these operations.

2) Aim:
The aim of this code is to demonstrate bitwise operations, specifically the bitwise AND and bitwise OR operations, on two user-input numbers.

Theory:

Bitwise AND (&) Operation:

Bitwise AND combines two integers by setting the corresponding bits only if both 
operands have those bits set. The result has the bits set where both operands have bits set.
Bitwise OR (|) Operation:

Bitwise OR combines two integers by setting the corresponding bits if at least one of them is set. The result has the bits set where either of the operands has a bit set.
Algorithm:

Declare four integer variables: number1, number2, var1, and var2.

Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in number1.

Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in number2.

Calculate the bitwise AND of number1 and number2 and store the result in var1.

Calculate the bitwise OR of number1 and number2 and store the result in var2.

Display the result of the bitwise AND operation as "Bitwise AND: var1".

Display the result of the bitwise OR operation as "Bitwise OR: var2".

Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

Conclusion:
This code demonstrates the use of bitwise AND and bitwise OR operations on two user-input numbers. It calculates and displays the results of these operations, showcasing how specific bits in the binary representation of the numbers interact with each other.
